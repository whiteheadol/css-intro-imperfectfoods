## Set Up Instructions
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `open index.html` to view your app in the browser

## Instructions
### Some notes:
- The HTML is already there for you, but feel free to change that file as you wish (add elements, add IDs or classes, etc).  
- The CSS file has the font and colors listed for you. You do not need to import anything for the font, we've done that for you (HTML line 5).
- Don't worry about the worn design in the background. We will just make the background one solid color.

### Iteration 1 (after `CSS: Fundamentals` lesson):
- Make the text match the font and sizing from the comp
- Make the colors match the comp
- Make the image sizes match the comp
- Style the button to match the comp

### Iteration 2 (after `CSS: Flexbox` lesson):
- Use flexbox to make the layout match the comp (hint: you may need to add container elements to your HTML to group the `img`, `h2`, and `p` elements)
